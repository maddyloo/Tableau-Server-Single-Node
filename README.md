## Tableau Server and deployed resources overview

Tableau Server on Azure is browser and mobile-based visual analytics anyone can use.  Publish interactive dashboards with Tableau Desktop and share them throughout your organization. Embedded or as a stand-alone application, you can empower your business to find answers in minutes, not months.  By deploying Tableau Server on Azure with this quickstart you can take full advantage of the power and flexibility of Azure Cloud infrastructure.  

Tableau helps tens of thousands of people see and understand their data by making it simple for the everyday data worker to perform ad-hoc visual analytics and data discovery as well as the ability to seamlessly build beautiful dashboards and reports. Tableau is designed to make connecting live to data of all types a simple process that doesn't require any coding or scripting. From cloud sources like Azure SQL Data Warehouse, to on-premise Hadoop clusters, to local spreadsheets, Tableau gives everyone the power to quickly start visually exploring data of any size to find new insights.
